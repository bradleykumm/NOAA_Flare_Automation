                           EDITED SOLAR EVENTS LISTS
			   
------------------------------------------------------------------

 Jan 28, 2011 -- Edited Events lists from Jan 24 through 28 had bad
     Radio and Flare date/times. The files have been corrected.
     
------------------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains the last 60 daily files of preliminary solar 
event reports received at SWPC and manually reviewed and edited by the 
duty forecaster. SWPC compiles these lists from preliminary reports 
received from contributing stations. Incorrect, missed, and incomplete 
reports are possible.

Files for the current full year, and earlier years are online from 1996.
See the SWPC FTP server ftp.swpc.noaa.gov at  /pub/warehouse or via a 
web browser: http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/ftpmenu/warehouse.html

Today's list is updated every 30 minutes at 2 and 32 minutes past the hour. 
Yesterday's list is updated every 3 hours, and the lists for the past 3 days 
are recreated daily at 0302 to pick up late additions or changes.

Filename format: YEARMODAevents.txt -- 4 digit year, 2 digit month, 2 digit day.
In addition,   "events.txt"       contains the current day's list.
               "yesterday.txt"    contains the previous day's list.

A subset, called the "energetic events" is available in other SWPC products.

A sample list and descriptions of each field are included below. 
The format is fixed, 80 columns wide, with standard headers.
If no events are reported a single line is shown
  NO EVENT REPORTS.

DESCRIPTION:
The first line is the filename.
The second line indicates the date/time the list was created.
The third line contains the date of the data. Each file (list) contains one UTC day.
Lines that begin with # are header lines.


Event - This is an arbitrary event number assigned by SWPC. It groups several
        reports into a single event, as determined by the SWPC forecaster.
+     - A plus sign (+) after the event number indicates that more than one 
        report was received for this event, and the forecaster has selected 
        this report to represent those received. 

Begin, Max, End  - 
        The UTC Time (Coordinate Universal Time, same as UT) of the beginning, 
        maximum, and end of the event as reported by the observing site. 
        "////" indicates a missing time. 
        The UTC day of the event's begin time is the UTC day of the list. 
        The UTC day of the maximum and/or end times may or may not be the same 
        as the begin time. Most solar events are several hours in duration. If 
        the maximum or end time is less than the begin time, then assume the 
        times are for the next UTC day. A single letter can proceed a Begin, Max, 
        or End time. A=after, B=before, U=uncertain. For example the begin time 
        A0146 means the event began after 0146. 

        The begin time of an x-ray event is defined as the first minute, in a 
        sequence of 4 minutes, of steep monotonic increase in 0.1-0.8 nm flux. 
        The x-ray event maximum is taken as the minute of the peak x-ray flux. 
        The end time is the time when the flux level decays to a point halfway 
        between the maximum flux and the pre-flare background level. 

        The begin time of an SXI flare (XFL) is minutes following the associated
        x-ray event. The maximum time is the most intense period in the brightest 
        region of the SXI image. The end time is the last SXI image before the X-ray
        event end time. 

Obs   - The reporting observatory.
        CUL - Culgoora, Australia
        HOL - Holloman AFB, NM, USA    LEA - Learmonth, Australia
        PAL - Palahua, HI, USA         RAM - Ramey AFB, PR, USA
        SAG - Sagamore Hill, MA, USA   SVI - San Vito, Italy
        Events from GOES satellites data show the SWPC Primary or Secondary
        GOES spacecraft for the observatory, e.g. G12

           (See the "Station Lists" directory in the "Welcome" directory for
            more information.)

Q     - Quality
        For radio bursts at fixed and sweep frequencies, and for storms, this 
        shows the quality of the data
                       C = Corrected report
                       G = Good 
                       U = Uncertain
        For optical flares, this shows the quality of observing conditions, 
        from 1 to 5, where:  1 = very poor and 5 = excellent
        
        X-ray events and SXI flare have a quality of 5 (meaning excellent).

Type  - Type of report, see http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/info/glossary.html
          BSL = Bright surge on the limb
          DSF = Filament disappearance
          EPL = Eruptive prominence on the limb
          FIL = Filament
          FLA = Optical flare observed in H-alpha 
          FOR = Forbush decrease (cosmic ray decrease))
          GLE = Ground-level event (cosmic ray increase)

Loc/Frq - Location or frequency.
	Location is in degrees latitude, north or south, and degrees longitude,
        east or west, from central meridian. The location is the spherical, 
        heliographic coordinates of the solar region, as a distance in degrees 
        from a line extending from the solar equator (heliographic latitude), 
        and distance in degrees from a line extending from the north solar 
        rotational pole to the south solar rotational pole through the center 
        of the solar disk, as viewed from Earth (central meridian) in H-alpha.

        Frequencies are in Mhz.

Particulars - Additional information from the report, chosen on the basis of 
        the report type.

Reg# - The SWPC-assigned solar region number. The daily SWPC Solar Region 
       Summary report contains detailed information about solar regions.
       see http://swpc.noaa.gov/ftpmenu/forecasts/SRS.html
	   
	   For optical events, region numbers are assigned by the observatory.
	   Region numbers are assigned to X-ray events by SWPC staff.

       For SXI flares, an SWPC algorithm finds the brightest area in the SXI 
	   image and assigns the region number of the closest active solar region. 
	   A region number is assigned to off-disk, west limb events if the region 
	   recently rotated around the limb.

             GOES 14 Became Primary Satellite for XRS data
   
December 1, 2009: GOES 14 is the Primary SWPC GOES Satellite for X-ray Events.
There is no Secondary X-ray Satellite at this time.

                 SEC Secondary GOES Spacecraft Change

  June 19, 2006 -- At 1400UT, June 22, the SEC secondary GOES satellite 
  for magnetometer, X-ray, and electron measurements will change from 
  GOES 10 to GOES 11. GOES 12 will continue as the primary SEC GOES 
  satellite. For energetic proton measurements there is no change; 
  GOES 11 will remain the primary SEC GOES satellite and GOES 10 will 
  remain the secondary. SEC products that include magnetometer, X-ray, 
  and electron measurements from the secondary SWPC GOES satellite will 
  change at that time. See details at http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/goes.html
  
  In the Edited Solar Events Lists, the Observatory field for events 
  from the GOES primary and secondary satellites will be G12 and G11.

January 5, 2004 -- GOES Solar X-ray Imager (SXI) flare (XFL) reports were 
added to the Edited Solar Events Lists. SXI flares from GOES-12 provide 
valuable flare location and other information, especially when no optical 
observations are available. SEC developed the SXI flare algorithm, triggered 
by GOES X-ray events, which finds the brightest area in the latest SXI image 
and assigns the region number of the closest active solar region. A region 
number is assigned to off-disk, west limb events if the region recently 
rotated around the limb. Near-real-time SXI images and a description of the 
GOES SXI instrument are at http://swpc.noaa.gov/sxi/

September 8, 2003 -- The Filament disappearance (Type = DSF) reports now 
have an associated location.  See description on Loc/Frq below.

                          GOES Satellite Changes 
         
On May 15, 2003 GOES-12 became SEC's primary GOES satellite, and GOES 10 
the backup. Event Lists show GOES 12 and GOES 10 XRA events.
